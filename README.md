# Class-Base
_Class-Base_ is a small project that involves web-scraping and and the use of a Genetic Algorithm for schedule optimization.
The script helps to generate different class schedules for students at the University of California, Irvine.

This project was mainly created as a way for me (Kevin) to learn more about Python as well as exploring different modules
and algorithms frequently used in practice.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
_Class-Base_ makes use of several open source modules to make web-scraping and text parsing simplier.

#### Dependencies
+ [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) - is used in _Class-Base_
as a way to parse HTML from the UCI class search page.
> "Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files."
+ [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) - is used in _Class-Base_ as a way to navigate
through JavaScript rendered web pages while web-scraping.
> "Selenium is an open source tool which is used for automating the tests carried out on web browsers (Web applications are tested using any web browser)."
+ [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) - because _Class-Base_ makes use of a Genetic Algorithm for optimizing
class schedules, probability and randomization functions from NumPy are used. 
> "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python."
